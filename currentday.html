    <p class="fade-in-text">The typeface Engraver’s Old English bears a resemblance to titles or mastheads found in 19th-century newspaper publications. These publications include The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times, directly infulenced Engraver's Old English. Engraver's Old English continued the legacy of typefaces for newspaper titles. For over two centuries, the typeface for these newspaper publications remained consistent. When these newspaper publications were founded, blackletter typefaces were reserved exclusively for titling, rather than body text. It is reserved for titles because it is eye-catching, authoritative, and decorative. Crucially, it is never used for article body text because its elaborate forms severely restrict readability at smaller point sizes.

        <p class="fade-in-text">The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times rely on custom blackletter typefaces. The New York Times is one of the most well-known newspaper publications. It uses typography to strongly emphasize tradition and authority. The dense strokes and ornate letterforms visually connect its engraved typefaces. The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post employ a custom blackletter masthead that reflects tradition while reinventing the typeface. In other words, the typeface remains relevant while preserving its historic character. It features thin white lines that follow the contours of the letters. These thin white "cut" inside the heavy black strokes gives the logo a more layered and engraved appearance that mimics 19th-century metal plate engraving.

The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times rely on custom blackletter typefaces. The New York Times uses typography to strongly emphasize tradition and authority. The dense strokes and ornate letterforms visually connect its engraved typefaces. The Washington Post also employs a blackletter typeface to convey authority, in a more restrained and modern manner. Its masthead is blackletter-inspired but simplified, avoiding heavy ornamentation.
